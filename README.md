# Evan Madden - Phase One Portfolio

## ABOUT

This portfolio was made using only HTML and CSS. I followed step by step instructions from a youtube video, originally as a confidence-boosting side project.  I added my own touches, and decided to use it as a plaform for my first portfolio.  There s a lot of room to expand off of the basic design and structure.

## CONTENT

The first three cards link to my course work and group project. The last three cards are placeholders for real life experiences that are also current and future web development projects that I am working on.
