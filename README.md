# Evan Madden - Phase One Portfolio

## ABOUT

This portfolio landing page was made using only HTML and CSS. I followed step by step instructions from a youtube video, originally as a confidence-boosting side project.  I added my own touches, and decided to use it as a plaform for my first portfolio.  There is a lot of room to expand off of the basic design and structure.

### CONTENT

The first three cards link to my course work and group project. There are two cards that are placeholders for future web development projects, and a card that links to my GitHub Profile.
