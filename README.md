# Evan Madden - Phase One Portfolio

## ABOUT

This portfolio landing page was made using only HTML and CSS. I originally built this page locally, on a weekend as a confidence-boosting excercise. I wanted to see that I could create responsive css if I had step by step instructions. I followed step by step from a youtube video, and then added my own touches. Ultimiatelty I decided to use this as a plaform for my first portfolio.  There is a lot of room to expand off of the basic design and structure. One of the links is the original porfolio landing page I made for bootcamp.

### CONTENT

The first three cards link to my course work and group project. There are two cards that are placeholders for future web development projects, and a card that links to my GitHub Profile.
